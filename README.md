AVH-AutoValidate: Automated Data Quality Management
Introduction
AVH-AutoValidate is an innovative solution for managing data quality, ensuring the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of data in modern data-driven enterprises. The system automates the detection and correction of data quality issues, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing decision-making reliability.

Key Features
Automated Approach: Automates the detection and correction of data quality issues.
Adaptive System: Uses AVH (Average Variance and Histogram) metrics to dynamically adjust validation rules.
Unsupervised Data Validation: Leverages unsupervised learning techniques for continuous improvement.
Comprehensive Solution: Provides a robust framework for maintaining high data quality standards.
Methodology
Data Input

Source Retrieval: Acquire data from official sources (e.g., UK Government website).
Storage: Store data in AWS S3 buckets for scalable and secure access.
Pattern Inference

Analysis: Analyze datasets to infer patterns and identify data domains.
Domain Recognition: Recognize patterns using unsupervised methods.
Pattern Validation

Regex Application: Apply regex rules to validate data.
Initial Checks: Perform checks to filter out invalid data.
AVH Metrics Calculation

Metric Computation: Calculate metrics for understanding data distribution.
Historical Analysis: Establish baseline metrics for validation.
Constraint Suggestion

Automated Constraints: Suggest validation constraints based on AVH metrics.
Adaptation: Adjust constraints dynamically.
Cleaning Rule Creation

Rule Development: Develop cleaning rules based on patterns and AVH constraints.
Dynamic Rules: Ensure rules adapt to changes in data patterns.
Feedback Loop

Iterative Refinement: Continuously refine rules and constraints.
Improvement Tracking: Track improvements and adjust methods.
Benefits
Automation: Reduces manual effort, enhances consistency.
Accuracy: Improves data accuracy and reliability.
Scalability: Efficiently handles large datasets.
Comparison with Other Solutions
Amazon Deequ and Great Expectations: Require significant manual rule creation and refinement.
AVH-AutoValidate: Automates rule generation and refinement, reducing manual intervention.
Examples of Detected Issues
Missing entries in CompanyName with special characters (e.g., "Pharma !& Ltd").
Inconsistent RegAddress.PostCode formatting.
Non-numeric values in Accounts.AccountRefMonth.
Inconsistent and future dates in various fields.
Regex Pattern Example
Pattern: r"^[A-Za-z0-9\s\-()]+$"
Application: Validate and clean the CompanyName values.
Limitations and Areas for Improvement
Initial Setup Complexity: Requires comprehensive configuration.
Dependence on Historical Data: Needs sufficient historical data for effective validation.
Handling Unstructured Data: Improvements needed for unstructured data handling.
Future Enhancements
Improved Scalability: Enhance handling of large datasets.
Enhanced Unstructured Data Handling: Improve methods for unstructured data.
Adaptive Learning Mechanisms: Develop smarter learning algorithms.
User-Friendly Interfaces: Create intuitive interfaces for users.
